Here is the repository for ASE submission "Correlation-Aware Performance Issue Identification in Cloud Service Systems".
The industrial dataset can not be directly used at this time, though the model can run. We will provide our compelete feature defination list upon acceptance.
After that, you can directly extract the features using our calculation code and detect anomalies using our isolation forest.

## Data
We only put one sample of our industrial dataset here. A subset of SMD is also uploaded. However, upon acceptance of this work, we will release all datasets used in our study, including raw data and all labels, and any other relevant materials necessary for replication and analysis of our findings.

## Requirements


## Running
Cd to the working directory and simply run:
```python train.py```
