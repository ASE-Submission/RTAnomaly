## Data

We only put one sample of our industrial dataset and SMD dataset here (due to limit of space). However, upon acceptance of this work, we will release all datasets used in our study, including raw data and all labels, and any other relevant materials necessary for replication and analysis of our findings.

## Requirements

Python $\geq$ 3.8 is needed. Besides, the environment can be built by:
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Running
Cd to the working directory and simply run:
```python train.py```
